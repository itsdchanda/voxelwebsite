      <h1 class="mb-3">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 2025</p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">1. Controlled Use of Information</h2>
      <p>
        Voxel Networks does not collect visitor data via this website. However,
        any information shared with us voluntarily — including name, contact
        details, or business needs — becomes part of our internal communication
        records and may be retained indefinitely for reference, improvement of
        services, and legal protection.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">2. Ownership of Business Communications</h2>
      <p>
        All business discussions, emails, proposals, and shared documents remain
        confidential and proprietary to Voxel Networks unless otherwise agreed
        in a signed legal contract. Clients are not permitted to publish,
        disclose, or forward communication threads or materials without explicit
        written consent from Voxel Networks.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">3. Third-Party Data Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        If third-party tools (e.g., embedded videos, font APIs, or forms)
        collect data, their respective privacy policies apply. Voxel Networks is
        not liable for how these tools operate or what data they gather. Use of
        such tools is assumed to be accepted by the visitor by virtue of
        accessing the page.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">4. Commercial Communication Rights</h2>
      <p>
        By initiating contact with Voxel Networks via email, call, or messaging,
        clients authorize us to communicate marketing, follow-ups, service
        updates, or offers unless an explicit opt-out request is made. This is
        in line with India’s IT Rules and globally accepted business
        communication practices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Any client-related data, including project briefs, conversation logs,
        and reference materials, may be archived securely to support our
        business continuity, future upgrades, or legal compliance. Clients
        cannot demand erasure unless such a right is granted under an applicable
        law or contract.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">6. Liability Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        Voxel Networks provides no guarantees about privacy protections beyond
        the scope of this document. By using this site or reaching out to us,
        clients accept that any voluntary information shared is managed solely
        at our discretion, and we are under no obligation to comply with
        third-party or foreign privacy laws unless formally agreed.
