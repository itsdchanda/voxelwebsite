    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the

    </p>
    <h1>1. Purpose and Scope</h1>
    <p>
      This Website acts as a digital portfolio and presentation tool for Voxel
      Networks, a design, development, and software-as-a-service (SaaS)
      consultancy. The site does not facilitate or enable direct financial
      transactions, nor is it meant to operate as a contractual interface. All
      discussions related to commercial services, payments, timelines, or
      deliverables occur exclusively via private consultation and secure
      communication channels.
    </p>
    <h1>2. Use of Third-party and Open Source Elements</h1>
    <p>
      Some visual or structural components on this site may originate from
      publicly available UI kits, free-use repositories, or creative commons
      licenses. This includes but is not limited to CSS templates, placeholder
      icons, or animations derived for prototyping. While utmost care is taken
      to customize and distinguish final outputs, incidental similarities may
      occur. Voxel Networks disclaims any liability arising from fair-use
      integrations compliant with Section 52 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957,
      and similar global fair usage frameworks.
    </p>
    <h1>3. Ownership of Intellectual Property</h1>
